#### Step 1: Information Gathering.
First of all we need to get connected to tryhackme's network using openvpn. Once connected Deploy the machine. 
If you don't know about the openvpn you can join this room https://tryhackme.com/room/openvpn

We will be using a tool called **Nmap** (network mapper) to gather information about the various service runnig on the machine.
Nmap is a great network scanning tool. https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnmap This room will help you with the basic of Nmap commannds.  

Enough with the talk Let's get into scannig the machine.
 
 Once the machine is deployed they will give an ip address. As shown in the Figure.
